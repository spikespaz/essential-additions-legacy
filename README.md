This is the decompiled & fixed up source of my first public repository, two years after it's first incarnation as an Eclipse project on my hard drive in 2016.

The new version resides at <https://github.com/EssentialMC/essential-additions>, which I maintained (with [@thvardhan]'s gracious assistance) up to Minecraft 1.12.2.
